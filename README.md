# Tangible React Components
Tangible is intended to be a visual language of styles, layouts, components, patterns, and rules that provide a consistent, thoughtful approach to user interface design. 

When Tangible is implemented, we create the opportunity to focus on designing user experiences that are more meaningful, more engaging, more enriching, and ultimately more personal.

## Getting Started

First ensure you have a React app create - preferably with create-react-app. 

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have a React app created - preferably with create-react-app
The accordion UI was built using [react-accessible-accordions](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-accessible-accordion?activeTab=dependents)


### Installing

Download and add the tangible.css file to the css folder in your app

1. In the App.js file import tangible.css

```
import "./assets/css/tangible.css";
```

## Colors

To edit the colors of the app simply open the tangible.css file and **control + f** search for 
* /* primary
* /* secondary
* /* primary text 
* etc. (they are listed in the file)

Then replace the hex or rgb value to your desired color
